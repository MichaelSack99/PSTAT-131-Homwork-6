## Tree-Based Models

For this assignment, we will continue working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

**Note: Fitting ensemble tree-based models can take a little while to run. Consider running your models outside of the .Rmd, storing the results, and loading them in your .Rmd to minimize time to knit.**

### Exercise 1

Read in the data and set things up as in Homework 5:

- Use `clean_names()`
- Filter out the rarer Pokémon types
- Convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors

Do an initial split of the data; you can choose the percentage for splitting. Stratify on the outcome variable.

Fold the training set using *v*-fold cross-validation, with `v = 5`. Stratify on the outcome variable.

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`:

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;
- Center and scale all predictors.

```{r}
Pokemon <- read_csv("/Users/michellesack/Desktop/UCSB/Senior yr/Spring/PSTAT 131/homework-2/PSTAT-131-Homwork-6/homework-6/data/Pokemon.csv")
Pokemon_cleaned <- clean_names(Pokemon)
head(Pokemon_cleaned)
```

```{r}
Pokemon_filtered <- filter(Pokemon_cleaned, type_1 %in% c("Bug", "Fire", "Grass", "Normal", "Water", "Psychic"))

Pokemon_filtered$type_1 <- as.factor(Pokemon_filtered$type_1)
Pokemon_filtered$legendary <- as.factor(Pokemon_filtered$legendary)

set.seed(0722)
pokemon_split <- initial_split(Pokemon_filtered, prop = 0.80,
                                strata = type_1)
pokemon_train <- training(pokemon_split)
pokemon_test <- testing(pokemon_split)
nrow(pokemon_train)
nrow(pokemon_test)
```

```{r}
pokemon_folds <- vfold_cv(pokemon_train, v = 5, strata = type_1)

pokemon_recipe <- recipe(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense + hp + sp_def, data = pokemon_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_novel(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_center(all_predictors())
```

### Exercise 2

Create a correlation matrix of the training set, using the `corrplot` package. *Note: You can choose how to handle the continuous variables for this plot; justify your decision(s).*

```{r}
 pokemon_train %>% select(is.numeric) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  corrplot(type = 'lower', diag = FALSE, 
           method = 'number')
```

What relationships, if any, do you notice? Do these relationships make sense to you?

I noticed that the variable "total" is highly correlated to all of the other predictors. This makes sense as the total depends on each predictor! 

### Exercise 3

First, set up a decision tree model and workflow. Tune the `cost_complexity` hyperparameter. Use the same levels we used in Lab 7 -- that is, `range = c(-3, -1)`. Specify that the metric we want to optimize is `roc_auc`. 

```{r}
tree_spec <- decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine("rpart")

class_tree_spec <- tree_spec %>%
  set_mode("classification")

class_tree_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(class_tree_spec %>% set_args(cost_complexity = tune())) %>%
  add_formula(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense + hp + sp_def)

param_grid <- grid_regular(cost_complexity(range = c(-3, -1)), levels = 10)

tune_res <- tune_grid(
  class_tree_wf, 
  resamples = pokemon_folds, 
  grid = param_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc))
```

Print an `autoplot()` of the results.

```{r}
autoplot(tune_res)
```

What do you observe? Does a single decision tree perform better with a smaller or larger complexity penalty?

It appears that a single decision tree performs better with a smaller cost-complexity, as there is a negative slope to our graph.

### Exercise 4

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing pruned decision tree on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
arrange(collect_metrics(tune_res), desc(mean))
```
As shown in the table above, the largest mean roc_auc is about 0.66.

### Exercise 5

Using `rpart.plot`, fit and visualize your best-performing pruned decision tree with the *training* set.

```{r}
best_complexity <- select_best(tune_res)

class_tree_final <- finalize_workflow(class_tree_wf, best_complexity)

class_tree_final_fit <- fit(class_tree_final, data = pokemon_train)

class_tree_final_fit %>%
  extract_fit_engine() %>%
  rpart.plot()
```
  
### Exercise 5

Now set up a random forest model and workflow. Use the `ranger` engine and set `importance = "impurity"`. Tune `mtry`, `trees`, and `min_n`. Using the documentation for `rand_forest()`, explain in your own words what each of these hyperparameters represent.

```{r}
rf_spec <- rand_forest(mtry = tune(), trees = tune(),min_n = tune()) %>%
  set_engine("ranger", importance = 'impurity')%>%
  set_mode("classification")

reg_tree_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(rf_spec) %>%
  add_formula(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense + hp + sp_def)
```

mtry represents the amount of variables that we use at each split, while trees represents the number of trees we us and min_n represents the minimum number of nodes. 

Create a regular grid with 8 levels each. You can choose plausible ranges for each hyperparameter. Note that `mtry` should not be smaller than 1 or larger than 8. **Explain why not. What type of model would `mtry = 8` represent?**

```{r}
param_grid_2 <- grid_regular(mtry(range = c(1, 8)), trees(range = c(1, 4)), min_n(range = c(3, 6)), levels = 8)
```

The reason we cannot have mtry be larger than 8 is because there are only 8 variables!

### Exercise 6

Specify `roc_auc` as a metric. Tune the model and print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? What values of the hyperparameters seem to yield the best performance?

```{r}
tune_res_2 <- tune_grid(
  reg_tree_wf, 
  resamples = pokemon_folds, 
  grid = param_grid_2, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc))

autoplot(tune_res_2)
```

### Exercise 7

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing random forest model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
arrange(collect_metrics(tune_res_2), desc(mean))
```

The roc_auc of my best-performing random forest model was approximately 0.68, where mtry = 4, trees = 4, and min_n = 6.

### Exercise 8

Create a variable importance plot, using `vip()`, with your best-performing random forest model fit on the *training* set.

```{r}
rf_spec_1 <- rand_forest(mtry = 4, trees = 4,min_n = 6) %>%
  set_engine("ranger", importance = 'impurity') %>%
  set_mode("classification")

rf_fit <- fit(rf_spec_1, type_1 ~ ., data = pokemon_train)

vip(rf_fit)
```

Which variables were most useful? Which were least useful?

The most important variable is sp_atk and the next most important is name. The least important variable is defense, and the second least most important is number

### Exercise 9

Finally, set up a boosted tree model and workflow. Use the `xgboost` engine. Tune `trees`. Create a regular grid with 10 levels; let `trees` range from 10 to 2000. Specify `roc_auc` and again print an `autoplot()` of the results. 

```{r}
boost_spec <- boost_tree(trees = tune()) %>%
  set_engine("xgboost") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

boost_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(pokemon_recipe) %>%
  add_model(boost_spec)

param_grid_3 <- grid_regular(trees(range = c(10,2000)), levels = 10)

tune_res_3 <- tune_grid(boost_wf, resamples = pokemon_folds, grid = param_grid_3, metrics = metric_set(roc_auc))

autoplot(tune_res_3)
```

```{r}
arrange(collect_metrics(tune_res_3), desc(mean))
```

What do you observe? What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing boosted tree model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

The roc_auc of my best-performing boosted tree model on the folds is about 0.72 and has 894 trees.

### Exercise 10

Display a table of the three ROC AUC values for your best-performing pruned tree, random forest, and boosted tree models. Which performed best on the folds? Select the best of the three and use `select_best()`, `finalize_workflow()`, and `fit()` to fit it to the *testing* set. 

```{r}
prune_roc <- max(collect_metrics(tune_res)$mean)
random_forest_roc <- max(collect_metrics(tune_res_2)$mean)
boost_roc <- max(collect_metrics(tune_res_3)$mean)
roc_auc_values <- bind_cols(prune_roc, random_forest_roc, boost_roc)

colnames(roc_auc_values) <-  c('prune','random forest','boosted')
roc_auc_values
```

The boosted model performed the best out of the three models.

Print the AUC value of your best-performing model on the testing set. Print the ROC curves. Finally, create and visualize a confusion matrix heat map.

```{r}
best <- select_best(tune_res_3, metric = "roc_auc")
boost_final <- finalize_workflow(boost_wf, best)
boost_final_fit <- fit(boost_final, data = pokemon_test)
```

```{r}
augment(boost_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>%
  roc_curve(type_1, estimate = c(.pred_Bug, .pred_Fire,.pred_Grass, .pred_Normal, .pred_Psychic, .pred_Water))

augment(boost_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class) %>%
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```

Which classes was your model most accurate at predicting? Which was it worst at?

My model appears to be most accurate at predicting Water and Normal type Pokemon and least accurate at predicting Fire and Psychic type Pokemon.
